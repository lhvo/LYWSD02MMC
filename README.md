# LYWSD02MMC
How to collect Temp and Humidity from XIAOMI clock with out MI HOME account - RASPBERRY PY

The approach: 
# 1- BLE Characteristic identification
To look for Temperature & Humidity characteristic - Using BLE Scanner.  
With the "Characteristic" can be identified. In the case of LYWSD02MMC the UUID is ebe0ccc1-7a0a-4b0c-8a1a-6ff2997da3a6.
# 2- BLE communication tracking
On one terminal run the "hcidump -X" to dump the BLE communication.
# 3- Turn on the notification 
On a second terminal run "bluetoothctl"  
Run "scan on" to detect and identify the MAC of the devices  
Run "connect <MAC Addr>" to connect to the device. 
A list of characteristic will be displayed. Identify the attribute wit the appropriate UUID (ebe0ccc1-7a0a-4b0c-8a1a-6ff2997da3a6) 
Run "select-attribute /org/bluez/hci0/dev_E7_2E_00_80_99_07/service003c/char004a" 
  
Turn the notification on "notify on"  

Check on the "hcidump" terminal - to identify the handle.  
  
> ACL data: handle 64 flags 0x00 dlen 9  
  ATT: Write req (0x12)  
     handle 0x004c value  0x01 0x00  
 ACL data: handle 64 flags 0x02 dlen 5  
   ATT: Write resp (0x13)  
 HCI Event: Number of Completed Packets (0x13) plen 5  
    handle 64 packets 1  

In our case we did see that the handle "0x004c" is used.
# 4- GATTTOOL command
As a conclusion the gatttool command to be used is :
> gatttool --device="MAC Addr" --char-write-req -a 0x004c -n 0100  --listen  
Characteristic value was written successfully  
Notification handle = 0x004b value: c3 0a 36  
Notification handle = 0x004b value: c6 0a 36  


For the model:
gatttool --device="MAC Addr" --char-write-req -a 0x0038 -n 0100  --listen  
  
# 5- Value conversions
>The temperature is c3 0a (little endian) => 0x0aC3(hexa) is 2755 (decimal) => 27Â°55 Celcius  
>The Humidity is 36 => 0x36(hexa) is 54(decimal) => 54% humidity.
